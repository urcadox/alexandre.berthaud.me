# My personal page

At first, this was supposed to be a no-JS page.

Sadly, Opera has a lot of trouble rendering the wide layout:
 * Opera Desktop doesn't render the picture, f'ing up the while thing
 * Opera Mobile simply crashes

I'm also forced to test for touch screens as the wide layout depends on the use
of hover, nothing standard in CSS to do that as of now.
